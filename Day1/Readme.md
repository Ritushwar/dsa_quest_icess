In recent times, many guys have been using attractive girls' photos as their profile pictures on social media. This makes it hard to tell a user's gender. Last year, Mr. WRC thought he was chatting with a girl online. They got close, even becoming an online couple.

But when Mr. WRC met "her" in person, he found out "she" was actually a strong man! This was a shock, leaving Mr. WRC heartbroken and reluctant to love again.

To prevent such surprises, Mr. WRC devised a 'Parity' method to guess users' genders based on their usernames. His method revolves around scanning the diversity of characters present in a username. Should this count yield an odd number, he surmises the user is male. Conversely, an even count leads him to speculate the user is female.

Now, with a username in hand, help Mr. WRC decide if this profile is real or fake.
